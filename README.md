# Led-blutooth-control-
This project allows you to control an RGB LED wirelessly using an Arduino Uno and an HC-05 Bluetooth module. Using simple commands sent from a Bluetooth-enabled device (like a smartphone), you can change the LED color, turn it on/off, and even make it blink in a color cycle.
